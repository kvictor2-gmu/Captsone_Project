                <ul>
                    <li>There are 24 columns with missing values in the dataset. Review missing values table below to assess severity.</li>
                    <li>92 rows are duplicated over all columns. There are 24 columns with duplicate values in the dataset. Review duplicates table below.</li>
                    <li>There are 9 columns with free form text. Review free-form-text table below for handling decisions.</li>
                    <li>There are 17 columns with datatype mismatch in the dataset. These columns have a datatype that is different from majority datatype of cell values. Review datatype mismatch table below.</li>
                    <li>There are 18 columns with outliers in the dataset. For numeric columns this refers to numeric value, for non-numeric columns this refers to value length. Refer to misfielded values table for handling decision.</li>
                    <li>There are 4 columns with potential misfielding/incorrect values in the dataset. Refer to misfielding tables below to verify these entries.</li>

Essentially I am the assistant manager with all functions of a manager, but don't have authority over hiring decisions, termination decisions, and can't do significant disciplinary action where termination is a result. In my role I manage team member scheduling, attendance, quality and safety reporting, I create education for the team, I manage compliance with education, I also manage quality improvement and evidence based practice projects, I also teach classes for our team. This is all with the expectation that I work as a charge nurse for a set amount of my hours. For some they have a 2/3rds of their time is working floor and 1/3rd indirect. This is dependant on the manager of the unit and their needs for the role.</td>

      <td>I work part-time, about 0.5 FTE (20 hrs/wk). When I took the role, it was offered that I could also work 0.5 FTE in another office to get up to 1.0 FTE, but I declined. My boss has repeatedly offered me 1.0 FTE in my office, and I have repeatedly declined, as I am also taking university classes part time and because I would find this job too stressful at 1.0 FTE. I also work the minimum number of hours required to access health benefits, paid vacation, pension, etc. I get 3 weeks of paid vacation each year, plus an additional ~2 weeks off at Christmas. I frequently work a bit over my set hours each week, but we are told not to record the time (I know!) and just take it off as lieu time later, which I try to keep on top of. There is some expectation that I am "on call" and able to respond to texts in off hours, but I make sure to record any time that I spend on this outside of my regular hours.</td>

We must earn minimum 100% of our allotted incentive quota in each financial quarter, and this amount can range up to 200%, depending on your performance, and role. \n\nSo as a rule, I would definitely be earning at least Rs.90,00 (Approx.) every quarter, with this amount going up to Rs.180,000 depending on my performance. \n\nThere are clear numerical performance parameters set in place to measure 100% performance from each employee, so there's no negotiation involved. You know what you'll get, based on your pre-set KPIs. \n\nIt's an unusual system of compensation and makes it difficult to explain to other employers that my actual, set income is in fact Rs.1,800,000 and not Rs.1,400,000.\n\nIn fact, I was planning to write in to you with a letter later this week, because I've been wondering how to explain this to potential employers without sounding like a scammer! In India the practice of asking for previous salary and basing offers on that is still the norm, so the usual advice of "don't disclose your previous income" does not apply to my situation, I'm afraid.</td>

As it is a horse farm, when there is a horse I want and can ride I am able to do that. I am able to use the farm truck and horse trailer to haul to go places to ride. The farm also owns the majority of the tack that I use when riding. I am allowed pets. Because my employer also owns another company I have health insurance that they pay a small portion of and a retirement account that they match up to 3%. Some may not sound like a big deal in the corporate environment but for the horse business it’s not bad. Some of my bonus money is based on horses successfully having babies and then how many horses I get pregnant for the next year. This can really fluctuate depending on not only Mother Nature but the goals of the farm. In years past we had 15-20 babies a year. Right now we are at 4-6.</td>
